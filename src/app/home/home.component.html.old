  DOT-to-DOT is a user responsive, open and reliable donation space characterised by a non-cash model (volunteering time and materials in kind). DOT-TO-DOT is a mobile-friendly website and app with a service package of eco-design, urban consultancy and civic workshops. It also offers social rewards like a e-DIY library, video training workshops, and local-made souvenirs. This technology puts "backers in frontline" by connected them in social networks (Facebook, Twitter  etc). It reduces operational costs by operating online; accepting donation from any currency with tailored donation plans; and prohibiting hidden administrative fees.
