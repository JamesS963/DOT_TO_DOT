<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
  At <b>Studio Pop</b> we are developing a new practice-led research agenda titled <b>Remaking the City</b> based on the New Urban Agenda Habitat III,
  circular economy and social innovation, with three cornerstones: <b>Waste, Gaps and Water.</b>

  â€‹</p>
<p>
  Our research informs social teaching and vice versa. This strength lies in our ability to bridge the gaps between research and co-design throughout a pedagogy centred in the culture of sharing knowledge. This is a circular model based on <b> THINK, PLAY & MAKE </b> as catalyst for creative, participatory and playful learning by transforming the city a play-place or evolutionary learning environment that inspires creative community to experience themselves as transformative agents of the built environment. Our work is ruled by utopias, games, and experimentation to stimulate dialogues, research about social forms and experimental designs.
